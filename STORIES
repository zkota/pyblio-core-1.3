* The database queries must remain coherent after modifications

Changing an entry that has not been updated in the DB should not
change a query result. Updating the DB should change the result.

* Import the XML into any Store

Create an empty Store of every existing type. Import an existing XML
database into it, with no loss.

* BibTeX keys are attributes.

The BibTeX key is an attribute that is part of the entry description.
Upon import, the importer is told which attribute name should hold
this information.

* Multiple users accesses cannot corrupt a DB3 database

Serial IDs are delivered atomically, and updates are transactional.
