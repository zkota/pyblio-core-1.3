This is the core API of the pybliographer framework. It provides
classes for managing bibliographic databases (storage, query,
conversion, formatting,...)


= Getting started =

Once the package is installed (see below), you can use the following
entry points to learn how it works:

  - the examples/ directory contains a few simple scripts with
    comments

  - the reference manual is available in HTML format in the doc/
    directory.


= Installation =

This package uses easy_install, and should fetch some dependencies
itself (except for the ones listed below).


== Requirements ==

 * python >= 2.3
 * ElementTree and cElementTree (http://effbot.org/zone/element-index.htm)


== Global installation ==

Once the required dependencies are installed, you can install this
package in the standard place with the following commands:

  * in the Recodec/ sub-directory
  
    python setup.py build
    sudo python setup.py install

  * in the directory containing this README

    python setup.py build
    sudo python setup.py install


== Developer mode ==

If you use pybliographer for your own developments and need to modify
pybliographer itself, you can run 

   sudo python setup.py develop

This will ensure that when you import Pyblio, you'll get the version
in _your_ working directory. No need to play with your PYTHONPATH
anymore.
