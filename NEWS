Release 1.3.4
--------------------------

 * Refactored the ResultSet management code: now, result sets are
   passive data that is not updated automatically in the bsddb store,
   and needs to be stored explicitely by using
   db.rs.update(result_set). The old db.rs.add(permanent) function is
   deprecated, and permanent=True has no meaning anymore. Use
   db.rs.new() instead.


Release 1.3.3 (2006-09-24)
--------------------------

 * Support for querying external databases. Available so far are
   PubMed, Web of Science and CrossRef.
   
   External data are retrieved in their own native format, ensuring
   that no data is lost unless the user does not need it. The query
   API is fully asynchronous (thanks to the Twisted framework,
   <http://twistedmatrix.com/>).

 * Support for transparently converting between database formats.

   By defining so-called Adapters, a database in format X can be
   manipulated as if it were of format Y. This is useful for
   integrating results from external databases, converting data,
   having specialized database schemas,...

 * Integration with OpenOffice.org and LyX

   A common citation mechanism allows to plug different word
   processors into pybliographer, and to manage citation, key
   generation, bibliography formatting.

 * Lots of internal refactoring

   The most visible for existing users is the fact that taxonomies are
   now completely integrated in the data schema, and not dynamic
   anymore. This was necessary to make the Adaptation mechanism
   easier. These dynamic taxonomies might be reintroduced later on
   with a more solid basis. Immediate consequence: for a Database db,
   please access db.schema.txo instead of db.txo.
