N2  - Adult Fisher 344 rats were subjected to a
      unilateral impact to the dorsal cortex
      above the hippocampus at 3.5 m/sec with a
      2 mm cortical depression. This caused
      severe cortical damage and neuronal loss
      in hippocampus subfields CA1, CA3 and
      hilus. Breakdown of the blood-brain
      barrier (BBB) was assessed by injecting
      the protein horseradish peroxidase (HRP) 5
      minutes prior to or at various times
      following injury (5 minutes, 1, 2, 6, 12
      hours, 1, 2, 5, and 10 days).Animals were
      killed 1 hour after HRP injection and
      brain sections were reacted with
      diaminobenzidine to visualize
      extravascular accumulation of the protein.
      Maximum staining occurred in animals
      injected with HRP 5 minutes prior to or 5
      minutes after cortical contusion. Staining
      at these time points was observed in the
      ipsilateral hippocampus. Some modest
      staining occurred in the dorsal
      contralateral cortex near the superior
      sagittal sinus. Cortical HRP stain
      gradually decreased at increasing time
      intervals postinjury. By 10 days, no HRP
      stain was observed in any area of the
      brain. In the ipsilateral hippocampus, HRP
      stain was absent by 3 hours postinjury and
      remained so at the 6- and 12- hour time
      points. Surprisingly, HRP stain was again
      observed in the ipsilateral hippocampus 1
      and 2 days following cortical contusion,
      indicating a biphasic opening of the BBB
      following head trauma and a possible
      second wave of secondary brain damage days
      after the contusion injury. These data
      indicate regions not initially destroyed
      by cortical impact, but evidencing BBB
      breach, may be accessible to neurotrophic
      factors administered intravenously both
      immediately and days after brain trauma.

N2  - A method is disclosed for detecting the
      presence of HTLV III infected cells in a
      medium. The method comprises contacting
      the medium with monoclonal antibodies
      against an antigen produced as a result of
      the infection and detecting the binding of
      the antibodies to the antigen. The antigen
      may be a gene product of the HTLV III
      virus or may be bound to such gene
      product. On the other hand the antigen may
      not be a viral gene product but may be
      produced as a result of the infection and
      may further be bound to a lymphocyte. The
      medium may be a human body fluid or a
      culture medium. A particular embodiment of
      the present method involves a method for
      determining the presence of a AIDS virus
      in a person. The method comprises
      combining a sample of a body fluid from
      the person with a monoclonal antibody that
      binds to an antigen produced as a result
      of the infection and detecting the binding
      of the monoclonal antibody to the antigen.
      The presence of the binding indicates the
      presence of a AIDS virus infection. Also
      disclosed are novel monoclonal antibodies,
      noval compositions of matter, and novel
      diagnostic kits
