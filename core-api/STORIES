* Import the XML into any Store

Create an empty Store of every existing type. Import an existing XML
database into it, with no loss.

* BibTeX keys and document classes are attributes.

The BibTeX key is an attribute of type ID that is part of the entry
description.  Upon import, the importer is told which attribute name
should hold this information. Similarly, the Document Class is an
Enumerated value, whose group is passed as a parameter.

* It is possible to search on a specific attribute

Queries are dependent on the type of the attribute being searched (for
instance, dates are ordered,...)

* Multiple users accesses cannot corrupt a DB3 database

Serial IDs are delivered atomically, and updates are transactional.

* Support "shortcuts" for persons and texts

When a phrase or person name is repeated frequently, a shortcut can be
defined, and used in place of the corresponding attribute. When the
shortcut content is updated, all the entries that used it are also
updated.

* Search for several words

The query can accept several words as a logical AND

* Manipulate result sets

Result sets can be merged together, entries can be removed or
added,...

* There are Permanent Result Sets.

They are stored in the XML format and in the storages.

* Schemas contain information about attributes (type, cardinality,...)

So that an attribute can have exactly one occurence, O..N, 1..N, ...
